🧾 Newly Registered Domains Blocklist

This project automatically generates and publishes blocklists based on newly registered domains, using data sourced from whoisds.com.


📦 Available Lists

      nrd-7.txt — domains registered in the last 7 days

      nrd-14.txt — last 14 days

      nrd-21.txt — last 21 days

      nrd-30.txt — last 30 days

      nrd-60.txt — last 60 days



⚠️ Important Notes

- These files are updated daily at 04:00 AEST.

- The data is aggregated directly from whoisds.com and may include false positives.

- This is a zero-maintenance blocklist — domains are not manually added or removed.

- The primary goal is to assist in automation and threat modelling, rather than provide a precision-targeted blocklist.
