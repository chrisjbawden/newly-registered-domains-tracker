⚠️ Important Notes

- These files are updated daily at 04:00 AEST.

- The data is aggregated directly from whoisds.com and may include false positives.

- This is a zero-maintenance blocklist — domains are not manually added or removed.

- The primary goal is to assist in automation and threat modelling, rather than provide a precision-targeted blocklist.
